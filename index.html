  <p>Although I had never envisioned myself as a Web Developer,
    I am now at a place in my professional life where I am training
    and nurturing future web developers and web coders. My BSc. In
    Information Systems & Management pushed me gently towards
    computer hardware and software and that is where my professional
    experience began. While doing that I started my own Graphic
    Design Business and I guess you can say that this is where the
    web design seed was planted.<br><br>

    From there I started my career in education and spent 12 years teaching
    ICT to young learners from the age of 13 to 17. During that time,
    I got my teaching certificate in Secondary Education and that solidified
    my status as an educator. I was still not a hard-core web developer yet,
    but I managed to commercially develop a few websites through my own
    business. This started me on a movement towards enhancing my skills in
    Web Development and before long I was spending hours honing those skills.<br><br>

    Since then, I have married the two strands of my professional life,
    Education and Web Development. I have gone from facilitating at
    web coding bootcamps to my current contract as a lecturer of Front-End
    Web Development and Mobile App Development.</p>
